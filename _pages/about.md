I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/departments/neurology/) at the [Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ali Ezzati](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/faculty/13307/ali-ezzati/) and [Dr. Richard B. Lipton](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/faculty/7405/richard-lipton/). My current work is focused on applying machine learning techniques to various aspects of the development, diagnosis, and study of Alzheimer's Disease.

My doctoral work, completed under [Dr. Robert V. Kohn](https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/kohn/) centered on the numerical study of superhydrophobics using both a phase field and classical energy approach to understand energy landscape by identifying metastable droplet states. Additionally, a novel, proof-of-concept surface optimization problem was studied that evolves towards an optimal surface geometry such that droplet rolling is more energetically probable than collapsing. This is achieved by minimizing an objective functional that is constructed to minimize favorable energy barriers and increase unfavorable barriers.
